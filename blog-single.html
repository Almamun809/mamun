                  The adoption of Computer Vision has been steadily picking up
                  pace over the past decade, but there’s been a spike in
                  adoption of various computer vision tools in recent times,
                  thanks to its implementation in fields like IoT,
                  manufacturing, healthcare, security, etc. Computer vision
                  tools have evolved over the years, so much so that computer
                  vision is now also being offered as a service. Moreover, the
                  advancements in hardware like GPUs, as well as machine
                  learning tools and frameworks make computer vision much more
                  powerful in the present day. Major cloud service providers
                  like Google, Microsoft and AWS have all joined the race
                  towards being the developers’ choice. But which tool should
                  you choose? Today I’ll take you through a list of the top
                  tools and will help you understand which one to pick up, based
                  on your need. 
                  <h3>Vision Tools/Libraries </h3>
                  <br />
                  <strong>OpenCV:</strong> 
                  post on computer vision is incomplete without the mention of
                  OpenCV. OpenCV is a great performing computer vision tool and
                  it works well with C++ as well as Python. OpenCV is prebuilt
                  with all the necessary techniques and algorithms to perform
                  several image and video processing tasks. It’s quite easy to
                  use and this makes it clearly the most popular computer vision
                  library on the planet! It is multi-platform, allowing you to
                  build applications for Linux, Windows and Android. At the same
                  time, it does have some drawbacks. It gets a bit slow when
                  working through massive data sets or very large images.
                  Moreover, on its own, it doesn’t have GPU support and relies
                  on CUDA for GPU processing. 
                  <br />
                  <strong>Matlab:</strong>  is a great tool for
                  creating image processing applications and is widely used in
                  research. The reason being that Matlab allows quick
                  prototyping. Another interesting aspect is that Matlab code is
                  quite concise, as compared to C++, making it easier to read
                  and debug. It tackles errors before execution by proposing
                  some ways to make the code faster. On the downside, Matlab is
                  a paid tool. Also, it can get quite slow during execution
                  time, if that’s something that concerns you much. Matlab is
                  not your go to tool in an actual production environment, as it
                  was basically built for prototyping and research.
                  <br />
                  <strong>Accord.NET:</strong> 
                  You’ll be excited to know that image
                  processing is possible even if you’re a C# and .NET developer,
                  thanks to AForge/Accord. It’s a great tool that has a lot of
                  filters and is great for image manipulation and different
                  transforms. The Image Processing Lab allows for filtering
                  capabilities like edge detection and more. AForge is extremely
                  simple to use as all you need to do is adjust parameters from
                  a user interface. Moreover, its processing speeds are quite
                  good. However, AForge doesn’t possess the power and
                  capabilities of other tools like OpenCV, like advanced motion
                  picture analysis or even advanced processing on images.
                  TensorFlow: TensorFlow has been gaining popularity over the
                  past couple of years, owing to its power and ease of use. It
                  lets you bring the power of Deep Learning to computer vision
                  and has some great tools to perform image
                  processing/classification – it’s API-like graph tensor.
                  Moreover, you can make use of the Python API to perform face
                  and expression detection. You can also perform classification
                  using techniques like regression. Tensorflow also allows you
                  to perform computer vision of tremendous magnitudes. One of
                  the main drawbacks of Tensorflow is that it’s extremely
                  resource hungry and can devour a GPU’s capabilities in no
                  time, quite uncalled for. Moreover, if you wanted to learn how
                  to perform image processing with TensorFlow, you’d have to
                  understand what Machine and Deep Learning is, write your own
                  algorithms and then go forward from there. CUDA: CUDA is a
                  platform for parallel computing, invented by NVIDIA. It
                  enables great boosts in computing performance by leveraging
                  the power of GPUs. The CUDA Toolkit includes the NVIDIA
                  Performance Primitives library which is a collection of
                  signal, image, and video processing functions. If you have
                  large images to process, that are GPU intensive, you can
                  choose to use CUDA. CUDA is easy to program and is quite
                  efficient and fast. On the downside, it is extremely high on
                  power consumption and you will find yourself reformulating for
                  memory distribution in parallel tasks. SimpleCV: SimpleCV is a
                  framework for building computer vision applications. It gives
                  you access to a multitude of computer vision tools on the
                  likes of OpenCV, pygame, etc. If you don’t want to get into
                  the depths of image processing and just want to get your work
                  done, this is the tool to get your hands on. If you want to do
                  some quick prototyping, SimpleCV will serve you best.
                  Although, if your intention is to use it in heavy production
                  environments, you cannot expect it to perform on the level of
                  OpenCV. Moreover, the community forum is not very active and
                  you might find yourself running into walls, especially with
                  the installation. GPUImage: GPUImage is a framework or rather,
                  an iOS library that allows you to apply GPU-accelerated
                  effects and filters to images, live motion video, and movies.
                  It is built on OpenGL ES 2.0. Running custom filters on a GPU
                  calls for a lot of code to set up and maintain. GPUImage cuts
                  down on all of that boilerplate and gets the job done for you.
                  Computer Vision as a Service: Google Cloud and Mobile Vision
                  APIs: Google Cloud Vision API enables developers to perform
                  image processing by encapsulating powerful machine learning
                  models in a simple REST API that can be called in an
                  application. Also, its Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
                  functionality enables you to detect text in your images. The
                  Mobile Vision API lets you detect objects in photos and video,
                  using real-time on-device vision technology. It also lets you
                  scan and recognise barcodes and text. Amazon Rekognition:
                  Amazon Rekognition is a deep learning-based image and video
                  analysis service that makes adding image and video analysis to
                  your applications, a piece of cake. The service can identify
                  objects, text, people, scenes and activities, and it can also
                  detect inappropriate content, apart from providing highly
                  accurate facial analysis and facial recognition for sentiment
                  analysis. Microsoft Azure Computer Vision API: Microsoft’s API
                  is quite similar to its peers and allows you to analyse
                  images, read text in them, and analyse video in near-real
                  time. You can also flag adult content, generate thumbnails of
                  images and recognise handwriting.

                  <strong>Bonus:</strong> SciPy and NumPy: I
                  thought I’d add these in as well, since I’ve seen quite a few
                  developers use Python to build computer vision applications
                  (without OpenCV, that is). SciPy and NumPy are quite powerful
                  enough to perform image processing. scikit-image is a Python
                  package that is dedicated towards image processing, which uses
                  native NumPy and SciPy arrays as image objects. Moreover, you
                  get to use the cool IPython interactive computing environment
                  and you can also choose to include OpenCV if you want to do
                  some more hardcore image processing.
